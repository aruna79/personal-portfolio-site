        Thanks for checking my page. I was born and brought up in India and now living in seattle for the past seven years.  I have two boys who keep me quite busy at home :)
        I am really enjoying currently being at Ada developer's academy.  Though the curriculum is challenging, it is fun and learning a ton.  I aspire to be a software developer and all the kudos to our instructors for all their hardwork.
